            <li> ¾ cup crushed gingersnap cookies</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lime zest</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut extract</li>
            <li>2 cups cubed fresh mango</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: brown;"> Directions:</h3>
        <ol style="color: chocolate;">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>Combine coconut, gingersnap cookies, and melted butter in a bowl; mix until evenly moistened. Press cookie mixture into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven until browned and set, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Beat softened cream cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. With the beater set to medium-low, slowly pour condensed milk into the bowl, mixing only until just blended and stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary. </li>
            <li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition; scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/2 of the cream cheese batter into a separate bowl. Stir lime zest and lime juice into portion in the new bowl; pour batter over crust in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Stir coconut extract through remaining cream cheese batter; pour over lime-flavored batter in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top of cheesecake springs back when gently pressed, about 45 minutes.</li>
           <li>Turn oven heat off, but leave cheesecake inside with the oven door slightly ajar until the oven cools completely. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.</li>
           <li>Prepare mango coulis by puréeing mango with sugar in a blender until smooth. If too thick, add 1 teaspoon water at a time, using just enough to make it pourable. Drizzle over cheesecake when plated.</li>
        </ol>
