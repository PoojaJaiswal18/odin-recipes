   <p style="color:chocolate;">Savor the flavors of summer with sliced fresh peaches cooking away with butter and spices. The topping can made from pantry ingredients you have on hand and peaches can easily be substituted with any fruit you have depending on the time of year. The tang of the lemon juice paired with the sweetness of the peaches is perfectly balanced with the crisp topping. Want to make dessert even better? A dollop of fresh whipped cream or cold vanilla ice cream truly makes it the perfect way to end a summer night.</p>
    <h3 style="color: brown;">Ingredients</h3>
    
    <h4 style="color:brown;">Crust</h4>
    <ul style="color:chocolate;">
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

        <h4 style="color:brown;">Filling</h4>
        <ul style="color:chocolate;">
        <li>3 pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
        <li> ¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color:brown;">Directions:</h3>
        <ol style="color:chocolate;">
            <li>Make crust: Sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Work in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together egg and cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle over flour mixture; work with hands to form dough into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roll out 1/2 of the chilled dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Place in a 9x13-inch baking dish, covering the bottom and halfway up the sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make filling: Mix peaches, orange juice, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Add butter and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Stir together sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix into peach mixture until combined. Pour into baked crust.</li>
            <li>Roll remaining dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into a lattice over peaches. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, then drizzle with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
